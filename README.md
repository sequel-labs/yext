### Step 1: Install the module

### Step 2: Build out your Yext Knowledge Graph

In order to power your Yext Answers Experience in Drupal, you will need to build out your Knowledge Graph. Yext provides resources to seamlessly and easily ingest information about your organization. In the Yext dashboard, navigate to the Knowledge Graph tab and click the "Add Data" button to learn more about Yext's Connector Sources and how to build a comprehensive Knowledge Graph.

### Step 3: Set up your Answers Experience in Yext

Once your Yext Knowledge Graph is built out, you can set up the Answers Experience that will be used on your site. Navigate to the Answers tab in your Yext dashboard to setup, configure and completely customize your Answers Experience.
